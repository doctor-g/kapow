    - Who is behind this?
    - What is the goal?
    - Who is endangered by this?
    - What is the best way out / in / through?

  On a miss, ask one anyway but be prepared for the worst.

- Convince (Taken wholesale from AW, needs re-theming)

  When you *convince*, tell them what you want and give them a reason, then roll+charismatic. 
  On a 10+, they go along with you until or unless the reason is betrayed. On a 7&ndash;9,
  they will go along with you if given concrete assurance, collaboration, or evidence.
  On a miss, be prepared for the worst.

- Read a Person  (Taken wholesale from AW, needs re-theming)

  When you *read a person*, roll+charismatic. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7&ndash;9, hold 1. While you're
  interacting with this person, spend your hold to ask a question:
      - Is your character telling the truth?
      - What is your character feeling?
      - What is your character's intent?
      - What does your character wish I would do?
      - How could I get your character to do a particular thing I want?
  
  On a miss, hold 1 anyway but be prepared for the worst.

- Help or Hinder 

  When you *help* or *hinder*, roll+bond. On a 10+, give a +2 or -2 to their roll.
  On a 7&ndash;9, they take +1 or -1 to their roll. On a miss, be prepared for the worst.

  Multiple heroes in appropriate situations can attempt to help or hinder, but only
  the highest modifier is used, and failures accumulate.

- End the Session

  When you *end the session*, do the following.
  1. The players decide which hero was the most heroic. That character earns +1 Experience.
  2. Each player either:
    - chooses another character that their character now trusts more and increases their bond by 1, or
    - chooses another character that their character mistrusts more and decreases their bond by one, 
      giving one experience to that other character as well.

- Advancement

  When you have five experience points, you are unthreatened in your HQ, and you *advance in experience*, 
  you may choose one advancement option from your playbook and reset your experience to zero.
  If you have no more advancement options, the character retires.


### Endurance

Each character has limited Endurance. Endurance is lost by being injured,
such as in a brawl, by inhaling poisonous gas, or when falling down a steep hill.
When a character loses Endurance, their player marks off a box on the Endurance
tracker. 
The second number in a character's Endurance is their _peril threshold_.
Every box marked from that point on applies a cumulative -1 to all rolls.

At the end of a scene, a character who is not imperiled may recover Endurance,
at the Narrator's discretion. Essentially, if there is any time to catch your breath,
you recover Endurance.
A character who became imperiled recovers instead to their _Recovery_ value.

A character who loses Endurance and has no more spaces in the Endurance tracker is in _Critical Condition_.
The player chooses one of the following:
- The character Recovers with permanent -1 to Mighty
- Change to a new playbook
- The character dies

If the character survives Critical Condition, the Narrator can determine how much Endurance
is granted the character.

### Experience

Whenever you fail a roll, mark one experience. 

(Character advancement rules could be put here, or just some way to )
