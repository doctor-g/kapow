\section{Campy Heroics}

Welcome to \kapow{}!

This tabletop role-playing game provides a framework for you
and your friends to create exciting, entertaining, and memorable
stories about a people in tights and masks who fight for justice.

This is a \textit{campy} superhero world, and the rules are designed
to support stories that fall into this genre. The heroes are noble and
honest, and the city doesn't know what they would do without them.
The villains are over-the-top sinister, with schemes that both boggle
and delight the imagination.
When words fail, fists prevail.
Characters use smoke bombs and knock-out gas, not guns and shivs.

The colors are bold and the characters are fundamentally simple.
There are no gritty 1990s anti-heroes, and there are no alternate
universe crossover events.
There are neither mutants nor aliens, and villains with anything you might
call a ``super power'' are extremely rare.
Think 1960s Batman or Johnny Quest, not Superman or the X-Men.

\section{Heroes and Narrators}

The game is designed for a small group of players, ideally no more than six.
All players but one will be \textit{Heroes} who are trying to save
their city from the schemes of hyperbolic villains.
The remaining player will be the \textit{Narrator}, who describes the world
and how it reacts to the heroes' actions.

Since you're reading this book, you're probably going to be the
Narrator. Congratulations! You're going to have a great time. With
just a little genre-appropriate prompting, you should be able to have
your players solving crimes and punching crooks in no time.
More guidance is provided for Narrators later in this book, but first
we have to cover some of the basics.

\subsection*{Playbooks}

Each hero will have a playbook that describes their role on the team.
Every iconic team brings together different characters with
different strengths: Frodo has different talents than Gimli;
Face is sent on missions on which B.\ A.\ Baracus would never succeed;
Batman can get Robin out of trouble, while Robin\ldots{}, well,
he mostly gets in trouble.
The idea behind playbooks will be familiar to those
who have played \textit{Apocalypse World}
or any of its Powered by the Apocalypse progeny.
For those who are new to this style of play but familiar with
some of the industry standard tabletop RPGs, a playbook is like
a character class in \textit{Dungeons \& Dragons} or \textit{Pathfinder}.

\subsection*{Attributes}
A hero has four attributes, which are explained briefly below.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Mighty} is a character's physical prowess--their strength,
  conditioning, and fortitude.
\item \emph{Focused} is a character's control over his mind and body,
  represented in their adroitness, precision, and self-control.
\item \emph{Intellectual} is a character's education and knowledge and their
  ability to apply these to new situations or problems.
\item \emph{Savvy} is a character's ability to operate in and manipulate
  the social world.
\end{itemize}

There are two other important characteristics of the heroes:
Endurance and Experience.
\emph{Endurance} represents how much they can
exert themselves before exhaustion, or how much of a beating they can
take before being critically injured.
Heroes earn \emph{Experience} throughout their adventures
by learning from failure and working together.

\subsection*{Contacts}
Each hero also has a Contact, who is someone outside the hero team
with whom the character has a special bond.
The hero may know the Contact in their heroic identity or in their
secret identity, and the Contact may or may not be aware of the
hero's dual life.
The contact is willing to do favors for the hero, but doing so also tends
to get them into trouble with villains' dastardly plots.

At the start of the game, a hero has a +2 to \move{exhort} their
Contact into action; this is the \textit{reliability} of the contact.
However, as a Narrator move, the reliability may be weakened (see
page~\pageref{move:change-reliability}). If the reliability is ever
reduced to zero, the hero must remove the Contact.

The Narrator is going to want to keep track of the Contacts
so that they can be used during the game. For example, a Contact
provides a great place to bring in a hook~(page~\pageref{sec:hook}).
It is recommended to keep a record of a Contact on an index card,
noting which hero has the Contact, the identities of which the
Contact is aware, and the nature of their relationship, along with
a space for notes you can take during gameplay.

\begin{example}
  Black Mask's Contact is his butler, Alan. During character
  creation, the Narrator makes a card like this:

  \begin{centering}
  \fbox{
    \begin{minipage}[l]{2.5in}
      {\sc Alan} \hfill Black Mask\\
      - Butler\\
      - Aware of secret identity\\     
  \end{minipage}
  }\\
\end{centering}
\end{example}


\subsection*{Bonds}
The relationship your hero has with each other hero is
represented as Bonds. Each hero has a specific Bond rating with
each other hero on the team, measured from -2 to +3. This impacts
how well a hero can help (or hinder!) a teammate.

\section{Moves and Rolls}
Whenever a hero wishes to do something in the world that
is possible and has a chance of failure, they make a \textbf{move}.
Opening an unlocked door does not require a move, but kicking a locked
one open would. Clapping your hands does not require a move, but
wriggling free when your hands are tied does.

To make a move, you choose the appropriate move from the basic moves
list or your playbook, then you roll two six-sided dice and add them
together, along with any relevant modifiers.  Generally speaking, a
result of 10+ means it is an unmitigated success. A total of 7--9
means that success comes at a cost. A total of 6 or lower means that
you have failed and the Narrator will be able to respond with a move
of their own (see Narrator Moves on page~\pageref{sec:narrator-moves}).

The basic moves that are available to every hero are named below,
and their full definitions can be found on page~\pageref{sec:basic-moves}.
\newenvironment{movedef}[\movedefarity]
{\item #1}{}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0px}
  \input{basicmoves}
\end{itemize}

Failing a roll may put the heroes in a bad situation, but heroes
can learn from their failures.
Each time your hero misses a roll, mark one Experience.

\begin{example}
  Black Mask is in a tussle with a group of lackeys.
  He rolls a 4, so even with his +1 Might, he fails the roll.
  The Narrator tells him that the lackeys overwhelm him,
  pinning him to the wall. The Black Mask learns something
  that day about fighting too many enemies at once, and
  he marks one Experience. Meanwhile, the Narrator chooses
  a move of their own.
\end{example}

Some moves give players a bonus or penalty \emph{forward}.
This means that on their next move, they apply that given bonus
or penalty in full. After the bonus or penalty is applied to a roll,
it is dismissed; the player no has zero \emph{forward}.

\begin{example}
  Black Mask and Captain Amazing are eyeing down
  the brutish bodyguards of the Barracuda.
  Captain Amazing gives an inspiring speech that grants
  The Black Mask +2 forward.
  Black Mask charges into the battle, adding an extra +2 to
  his rumble move. After mopping the floor with the bodyguards,
  Black Mask decides to investigate the scene. He already
  used his +2 forward, so there are no other special modifiers
  to his investigation.
\end{example}

Finally, some moves, such as \move{scrutinize}, give a hero \emph{hold}.
This means that the player marks a number of hold on their character
sheet and can spend them later for the indicated effect.
A player can only have \emph{hold} for one purpose at a time:
if they make a new move that grants \emph{hold}, the previous is lost.

\section{The First Session}

Before the First Session, the Narrator needs to do a little
preparation: creating a Villain and a short Scheme
that the heroes can try to unravel.
See page~\pageref{sec:session-prep} for additional notes
on how to create Villains and Schemes.
Make sure you have printed out copies of the playbooks and the moves
handouts, all of which can be found on the \kapow{} project Web site.

The first time you and your friends sit down to play the game,
you are going to need to create some characters and the ties
that bind them together.
\kapow{} is designed to make character creation fast, fun,
and interactive.

It's a good idea for the Narrator to start by reminding the players
about the campy superhero genre.
After that, they might explain the fundamental systems of the game:
players roll dice to make moves, and rolls are given bonuses
based on their character's attributes. 

The first step to making characters is to establish some
properties of their team.
Place the Team handout in the middle of the table and follow
the instructions from there.
Throughout the team and hero creation process,
cases where players must commit to a choice
are presented as open circles (\ding{109}) that
can be filled in or checked.

When it gets time to choose playbooks, the Narrator can read off
the short introductory blurb for each.
Each player selects a playbook for their hero. Two players may not
choose the same playbook.
The playbook then walks players through the hero creation process.

Once all the players are in the \emph{Bonds} step, then they go around
the table introducing themselves.
As a player shares the name of their hero, each other player should
write down the hero's name on their own sheets in order to
track their Bond with that hero.
Players should 
mention their character's heroic and secret identities, even if their selected
background means that their secrets are not known to the other
players. This can be considered ``off camera'' knowledge that the
players have but their characters do not.
Then, the players go around the table again, this time asking
any optional questions in the \emph{Bonds} section and then documenting
their initial Bonds.
Once Bonds are established, the players return to the Team sheet
for the final team creation steps.

Now that the characters have been created and introduced to each other,
it's time to get into the adventure.
The Narrator should give the hook for the adventure and then ask the
players, ``What do you do?''


\chapter{Hero Rules}

As a hero in the game, each interaction you have with the world
will be a \emph{move}. The general principle of playing \kapow{} is
``to do it, do it.''
That is, if you want your character to take action, identify the
most appropriate move, state it, and roll those dice.
If you are a new player, the Narrator may help you turn your
intention into moves, but this will become natural to you
in short order.

This chapter includes the definitions for all the \emph{basic moves}
to which all heroes have access. Heroes also have playbook-specific
moves that they may have selected during character creation or
advancement.  There are also a few \emph{special moves} that come up
in particular situations rather than in response to your intention.
The end of the chapter includes rules for dealing with
Endurance recovery and injury as well as optional rules for very young
players.

\section{Basic Moves}
\label{sec:basic-moves}

Below are the moves to which all heroes have access, regardless
of their playbooks. Like their playbook moves, players can invoke
them at any time that they are appropriate during a session.

\input{basicmoves}

\section{Special Moves}

The following special moves only come up in particular circumstances.
Players generally do not have agency over when they arise,
but neither are they Narrator moves that are played in response
to heroes' failures.

\input{specialmoves}

\section{Endurance and Rest}

Each character has limited Endurance. Endurance is lost by being
injured, such as in a brawl, by inhaling poisonous gas, or when
falling off a rooftop. When a character loses Endurance, their
player marks off a box on the Endurance tracker.
Marking off an Endurance box with a ``-1'' means that the hero takes
-1 to all rolls, independent of other bonuses or penalties.
The character is said to be \emph{imperiled}.

At the end of a scene, a character who is not imperiled may recover
Endurance, at the Narrator's discretion. Essentially, if there is any
time to catch your breath, you recover Endurance. A character who
became imperiled recovers to just beyond peril threshold.

A character who must lose Endurance and has no more spaces on the
Endurance tracker is in \emph{critical condition}. The player chooses one of
the following.
\begin{choices}
\item The character recovers Endurance at the Narrator's discretion but
  suffers a permanent -1 to Mighty. 
\item The character suffers a wound or trauma that permanently
  bans them from heroic life, and the character becomes
  an NPC.
\item The character dies.
\end{choices}
If the character survives critical condition, the Narrator can
determine how much Endurance is granted the character.

\section{Sidekicks}

Optionally, you can play \kapow{} with children who may not have the
reading ability or patience to deal with moves and playbooks.
These are called \emph{sidekicks}.
Odds are that if you're playing with a sidekick, you know the kid
and know they can handle.  The main idea here is that
you can incorporate such players to the extent they will enjoy it, and
it fits well in the genre.

An easy way to create a sidekick is to have the player draw their
character, and then you can ask them about it. Help them come up
with a name that fits the genre, and that's about all you need.
If they understand the idea of secret identities, you could have
them also draw what the character looks like when not in costume.

The rest of the team tracks their Bond with the sidekick, just like
the other heroes. However, the sidekick does not need to bother with
the bookkeeping of Bonds.

Sidekicks don't need attributes, nor do they track Endurance.
Rather, when they want to take an action that fits the normal
rules for a move---that is, it fits the narrative and
there's a reasonable chance of success or failure---have them
roll two six-sided dice and add them together.
On a roll of 7+, they succeed; otherwise, they fail.
The Narrator may choose to take a move in response to the failure,
but if they do, it should be something ``soft'' such as foreshadowing
future trouble.

\chapter{Narrator Rules}

This chapter contains all the rules for the Narrator.
As mentioned earlier, the Narrator needs to be familiar with all
the rules in the game in order to keep a good flow.
However, keep in mind one of the cardinal rules of tabletop
role-playing: it's almost always better to rule on the fly and keep
narrative momentum rather than stopping to look up an edge case.


\section{Principles}

There is a lot of freedom in \kapow{} to create interesting stories
with your players. The following principles are designed to help
you coordinate a good session.

\newenvironment{principle}[2]
{\subsection*{#1} #2}
{}

\input{principles}

\section{Narrator Moves}
\label{sec:narrator-moves}

Like the players, the Narrator's actions in the game are expressed
as \emph{moves}. However, the rhythm of the Narrator's moves is
different from the players.
There are two situations in which the Narrator gets to make a move.
The first is when the players fail a roll, which gives the Narrator
the opportunity to pick any move from the list.
The second situation is when there is a lull in the action or the
players seem to be looking to the Narrator to move the story forward;
in this case also, the Narrator can choose any move from the list.

\newenvironment{narratormove}[2]
{\subsection*{#1} #2}
{}

\input{narratormoves}

\section{Session Prep}
\label{sec:session-prep}

The Narrator is responsible for a bit of preparation before
a session, but once familiar with the process, it should not take
more than a few minutes.
Remember the principle, ``play to find out what happens.''
However, the camp superhero genre is so
infused with the \textit{mystery} theme that it's worthwhile
to make sure there's the spine of a story in place.
A seasoned Narrator may believe they can spin a compelling caper
extemporaneously, a few minutes of planning can help ensure a good
experience for everyone. \kapow{} definitely builds upon the
maxim that plans are worthless but planning is everything.

For the first session, the Narrator should create a conventional
over-the-top Villain and a relatively straightforward scheme.
Both of these are defined in the next chapter.
Facing this Villain will make new players more comfortable
with the game, and more importantly, relationships between characters,
Contacts, and the Villain will begin to form.
You don't know ahead of time which playbooks will be in play,
so it's best to keep the initial plan simple and iconic.

For the second session, it is recommended that the Narrator make
a slightly more elaborate Scheme with a different Villain. Try to
set up distinctly different situations that require different kinds
of skills. An advantage of the second session is that now you know
what kinds of heroes you have in the team. This means you can work
into the plan not just different locations and challenges, but also
consider how different Contacts might be brought into the action.

After the first two sessions, the Narrator should have a sense of the
play style of the heroes. Give them some of what they want, but
sometimes with a twist. Does a group like to rumble? Throw in an
armored villain. Does the group like to investigate or stake out? Make
a plot that requires thinking on their feet.

The heroes will also have some history with the Villains. Remember to
keep track of which heroes in particular offended the Villains and how.
This has all the ingredients you need for a great arch-nemesis story.


\chapter{Villains and Schemes}

Don't let the heroes fool you: it's the Villains that really make
the world of campy superhero adventure what it is.
A Villain in \kapow{} is one-dimensional and over-the-top. It's the
heroes' responses to the Villain's bizarre plans and ideas that
make each story distinct and memorable.

\section{Villains}

It is generally up to the Narrator to create Villains, although
other players may make contributions or even introduce one
on the fly through investigation (see page~\pageref{move:investigate}).
There are many places to draw inspiration for Villains.
You can, of course, clone one of the classics of the genre,
but it's also fun to make your own. Consider creating Villains
who are inspired by characters from famous novels or folk tales,
who draw from historical figures or cultures,
or who see themselves as connected to animals, plants, or forces of nature.

To start creating a Villain, you create a \emph{name}, a \emph{schtick},
and an \emph{appearance}.
These should all tie together into a cohesive, campy whole.
The name is something short and memorable that reflects the character.
The schtick is what makes the character unique---their motif, theme,
or concept. The appearance ties the name and schtick together.

\begin{example}
  \emph{The Paradox}'s schtick is that he loves contradictions
  and wordplay.
  He wears a mask that is half black and half white, and he wears
  a formal suit that is covered in black and white swirls and whorls.
\end{example}

Each Villain has a motivation for their life of crime. For most
Villains, this is either wealth or power---and really, that's
perfectly adequate for most games of \kapow{}. In some cases, a
Villain may have a completely different sort of motivation, such as
freeing all pets from the bondage of ownership, obtaining specific
cultural artifacts from museums, or even destroying the city.  These
motivations should be tied to the Villain's schtick.

Villains have Endurance at a similar scale to the heroes,
commonly a value between three and six.
This value should reflect their schtick: craven madmen have lower
Endurance than embittered ex-boxers.
No Villain worth his or her salt will stand toe-to-toe against a team
of heroes, dishing out punches until they are incapacitated.
Generally, if a Villain is knocked about sufficiently, they should
yield or try to bargain their way out of the situation.

Every Villain has \emph{lackeys}. These are the henchmen who carry out
the Villain's desires. The lackeys should have some unifying
appearance, and they are named in keeping with the Villain's schtick.
Generally, a Villain has enough lackeys for whatever it is that needs
to be done, but not so many as to completely overwhelm the heroes in
any given encounter.  Rank and file lackeys have one Endurance and are
easily eliminated from a rumble. In rare cases, and where it matches
their Villain's schtick, lackeys may be tougher. Keep in mind the
principle to keep the story moving: a battle with lackeys should be a
cinematic sequence and not a tactical wargame.

\begin{example}
The Paradox has a passel of lackeys that he derisively calls
\textit{The Oxymorons}. They include
Jumbo Shrimp,
Small Crowd,
Open Secret,
Original Copy,
and
Random Order.
The Oxymorons wear black slacks and shoes with white turtlenecks.
Their names are clearly written upon their shirts---the first word in a blocky,
monospace typeface and the second in calligraphic script.
\end{example}

Male villains are frequently accompanied by a female consort.
They may simply be arm candy for the Villain, but more often they are
implicated in the villain's scheme. Frequently, their association is secret,
which allows the consort to operate in public without drawing untoward
attention.

The consort tends to be one of the following:
\begin{choices}
\item An innocent young girl who was turned toward criminality due
  to a desperate or unfortunate situation. She may be persuaded
  to turn on the Villain.
\item A sweet-faced but internally-corrupted partner. She may
  lure the heroes into thinking they can persuade her to turn
  on the Villain, but it's a trap. (Setting up such a trap
  is a good example of the Narrator's \move{turn their move back
    on them} move.)
\item A strong, confident villain in her own right, who may very
  well be pulling the strings of her companion for her own
  nefarious scheme.
\end{choices}

\section{Villainous Schemes}
\label{sec:schemes}

Each session is defined by a Villainous Scheme. While it is possible
to set up multiple simultaneous Villainous Schemes, it is recommended
to let the heroes focus on one at a time: think of it like
each episode having a special guest villain who is guaranteed some
amount of time to chew up the scenery.

A villainous scheme is comprised of the Goal, the Hideout, the Setup,
the Hook, and the Plan.

\subsection*{The Goal}
The \emph{goal} is the Villain's endgame, the whole purpose for the scheme.
It should relate to the Villain's primary motivation.

\begin{example*}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Acquire the wealth and status of the dowager widow.
  \item Break the old gang out of prison.
  \item Steal the priceless diamond necklace and sell it on the black market.
  \item Have vengeance on the heroes by humiliating them
    at their own headquarters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example*}

\subsection*{The Hideout}
The Villain needs some strategic location from which to execute
his master plan. This is the \emph{hideout}.
The hideout should be tied, either directly or ironically,
to the Villain's scheme or schtick.
Generally, the hideout
should not be revealed to the heroes until the ramp up to the climax
or a cliffhanger.

It is a good idea to annotate a hideout with an appropriately
villainous deathtrap. This allows the Villain to capture one or
more heroes, tie them up, reveal his plan, and then walk away
and assume everything is going to be fine.

\begin{example}
  The Paradox is hiding out in the Bittersweet Chocolate Company
  factory in the industrial district. He has vengeance on his mind,
  and he has set up a life-size mold of Black Mask. If he can
  just capture Black Mask, then The Paradox will put him into the mold
  and start heating up the chocolate.
  As soon as the chocolate reaches a high enough temperature, it will
  pour into the mold. ``Sorry that I cannot stay to see you turned
  into the world's largest chocolate hero, but I have a date with
  a priceless Mesopotamian scroll at the World History Museum. Ta-ta!''  
\end{example}

\subsection*{The Setup}
The \emph{setup} is what the Villain has already accomplished by the
time the players come to the table. It cannot be stopped, but the heroes
may be able to ask questions about it in order to discover important
clues.

\subsection*{The Hook}
\label{sec:hook}
The \emph{hook} is the event that brings the heroes into the action.
It may be that the heroes are in the right place at the right time,
either by happenstance or by the Villain's intent (particularly
one who is motivated by revenge).
Most frequently, however, it is a call from a Contact that gives
heroes enough information to start making moves.

\begin{example}
  ``Black Mask: you get a call from Alan, your butler, who tells you
  that he just saw a giant clown balloon being paraded down the
  street by a group of dangerous-looking mimes. What do you do?''
\end{example}

\subsection*{The Plan}

The \emph{plan} is how the Villain will meet the goal if he
is not interrupted.
When the Narrator takes the \move{advance a villainous scheme} action,
a step of the plan is completed.

The Narrator articulates the plan in order to have
an idea of how the Villain will proceed. It should never be used
to railroad the heroes into a particular encounter path. Let the Villain
modify their plans as reasonable; the Narrator's ability to announce
off-screen trouble or foreshadow trouble are useful here.

It works well to articulate the plan as a simple series of verb
clauses, such as ``break into the museum,'' ``kidnap the porter,''
or ``take the diamonds to the fence.''

When the heroes inevitably catch up with the Villain and his lackeys,
it's generally a good idea to have a few more lackeys than heroes.
The real threat of the lackeys is often that they take time and attention
away from whatever the Villain is really trying to accomplish.
The Villain himself will not engage in combat while there are
enough lackeys to engage the heroes; indeed, some Villains may
never rumble at all, choosing escape or surrender over fisticuffs.


\chapter{References}

The main referent for establishing the genre is, of course,
the classic \textit{Batman} television series of the late 1960s.
The comics books of the same period portray a similar style.
Interested readers should look up the 1954 criteria of the
Comics Code Authority~(CCA). The CCA is a fascinating historical
document for understanding the cultural constraints placed on
mainstream artistic expression. The CCA rules actually provide
an excellent basis for campy adventures in \kapow{}.

This game is clearly inspired by D.\ Vincent Baker's and Meguey
Baker's excellent post-apocalyptic role-playing game,
\textit{Apocalypse World}. The author appreciates their inventiveness
as well as their openness to the community.
Interested readers should certainly investigate both
\textit{Apocalypse World} itself and the ``powered by the apocalypse''
movement at \url{apocalypse-world.com}.

Ending the session on a cliffhanger is a genre-appropriate
adaptation of the session end timer from
Brandish Gilhelm's inspiring \textit{Index Card RPG}.

This work was created as part of National Game Design Month (NaGaDeMon)
2019. Thanks to Nathan Russell for organizing the event and to the
